#  DESCRIPTION TOOLS AND LIBRARIES 

1. TOOLS:
These are not directly coded but are required to execute the script:

Python Interpreter:
-->  The script requires Python installed on the system (version 3.x recommended).
-->  Tools like pip may be required to install additional libraries if needed, though this script uses only built-in libraries.

Command-Line Interface (CLI):
-->  The script takes input (directory path) from the user via the command line and prints results to the console.

File System:
-->  The script interacts with files and directories, requiring a functional file system for traversing directories and reading file contents.

2. PYTHON LIBRARIES:
The script uses only built-in Python libraries, requiring no additional installations.

a)  os:
Purpose: Interacts with the operating system and file system.
Key Functions Used:
-->  os.path.exists(path) – Checks if the specified path exists.
-->  os.path.isdir(path) – Checks if the specified path is a directory.
-->  os.walk(path) – Recursively iterates over the directory structure, returning directories and files.
b)  hashlib
Purpose: Provides cryptographic hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
Key Functions Used:

-->  hashlib.sha256() – Creates a SHA-256 hash object.
-->  update(data) – Adds binary data to the hash computation.
-->  hexdigest() – Returns the final hash value in hexadecimal format.

c. Exception Handling
Purpose: Catches and handles runtime errors gracefully.
Key Constructs Used:
-->  try-except block to catch and print errors during file handling or hashing.
